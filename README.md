# TestFirstDevelopment
Test-driven development (TDD)  is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development (TFD), 
where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test, and refactoring. 
The primary goal of TDD is to make the code clearer, simple and bug-free.

## How to perform TDD Test
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails
3. Write some code
4. Run tests and Refactor code
5. Repeat
